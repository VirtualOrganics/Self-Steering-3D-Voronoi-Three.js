## How the self‚Äësteering works

We alternate two simple behaviours per site:

- Relax: briefly untangle overlapping neighbours using local repulsion. We look up the 4 closest neighbour IDs from the voxel grid (Buffer B) and push away with a small jump scaled by local breathing‚Äëroom.
- Steer: move each site along its cell‚Äôs main long axis. The axis comes from Buffer C (fast boundary sampling + covariance power‚Äëiteration). We apply steering with friction and min/max speed clamps and add soft repulsion to avoid overlaps.

This produces stable directional flow driven by current cell shapes. All distances scale with cube size relative to a 0.55 baseline, so behaviour stays consistent when you change world scale.

### GPU passes

- Buffer A (Positions): Applies relax/steer to positions with periodic wrapping.
- Buffer B (Voxel Owners): 3D grid of nearest IDs; updated every N frames with a small jump‚Äëflood refinement.
- Buffer C (Steering Signal): Samples each cell boundary via short rays to find the longest axis and its direction.
- Buffer D (State): Smooths the steering vector and manages the relax/steer timing (RELAX_DURATION / STEER_DURATION).
- Image/Main: Raymarches the Voronoi surface using the 4 nearest IDs from the voxel grid.

## Technical Details

### Architecture

The visualization uses a multi-pass rendering approach:

1. **Buffer A**: Calculates and animates site positions in local space
2. **Buffer B**: Maintains voxel grid acceleration structure using Jump Flooding Algorithm
3. **Main Pass**: Raymarches through the voxel grid with visual effects

### Shader Pipeline

- **Common Shader**: Shared utilities and constants
- **Buffer A Fragment**: Site position calculation with noise-based animation
- **Buffer B Fragment**: Voxel grid update with JFA refinement  
- **Main Fragment**: Raymarching with Voronoi distance calculations

### Key Technologies

- **Three.js**: WebGL framework for 3D graphics
- **GLSL ES 3.0**: Shader programming
- **WebGL 2.0**: Advanced GPU features including float textures
- **Vite**: Build tool and development server
